# the-homer-copter
The official repository of The Homer FPV quadcopter. Brought to you by a bunch of weirdos in Discord. 

# Requirements
- LIDAR
- a more complicated and less reliable product
- add an NNP for processing tensorflow models
- LIDAR, laser altimeter, hi res temperature/humidity, ToF, BLE scanner...
- a megaphone
- how loud of a horn can we fly? (loud as you want, just need a bigger boat to get it in the air)
- add a frequency blaster thing so we  can open doors
- RFID
- Speaker
- we also need to capture a bird (so we can steal its wireless charging circuit)
- Might as well add an LTE module and and wifi chipset for Warflying.
- 5g to pilot it remotely (we need to stay 1 g ahead of the normies)
- it needs to be dji and analog and hdzero and hdeezero
- PBR

## Round 2: 
- oh, i want the option for 3 more cameras btw
- we need all of the uarts

### Round 2(a): 
- do we have an i3c port
- CANBUS
- blackbox log
- we should probably have a firewire port for zip drive updating if needed
